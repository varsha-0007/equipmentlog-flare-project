# EquipmentLog Smart Contract

A simple and beginner-friendly Ethereum/Flare smart contract for recording and tracking equipment logs on-chain.  
This project demonstrates how to store data in a struct, push it into an array, and retrieve it using view functions.  
Perfect for learning Solidity basics or building lightweight on-chain log systems.

## 📌 Project Description

This project is a decentralized Equipment Logging system built using Solidity.  
It stores entries such as equipment name, description, and the timestamp of when the log was created.  
All data is permanently and transparently stored on the blockchain.

---

## 🔍 What It Does

- Allows anyone to add a new equipment entry with just two inputs:
  - **name**
  - **description**
- Saves the entry with:
  - Equipment Name  
  - Description  
  - Block Timestamp  
- Stores all logs permanently in a dynamic array
- Lets users retrieve:
  - Total number of logs  
  - A specific log by index  

---

## ⭐ Features

- 📄 **Simple and clean Solidity code**  
- ⛓️ **Fully on-chain storage**  
- 🔒 **Read-only getter functions (no gas)**  
- 🧩 **Uses structs and arrays (great for learning)**  
- 🕒 **Automatic blockchain timestamp recording**  
- 🧪 **Easy to test with Remix, Hardhat, Foundry, or Flare tools**
